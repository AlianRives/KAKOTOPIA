# KAKOTOPIA
Kakotopia is an interactive surreal world, an imagined landscape where familiar monuments that once symbolized a utopian society are now transformed in an isolated place. The viewer will go through a scenario that changes until becoming a state of decay or a Phildickian dystopian place.
